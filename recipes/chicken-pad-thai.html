    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> I always thought that I preferred lo-mein over other Asian noodle dishes, until the day I tried Pad Thai. Where had this heavenly dish been all of my life? When I met my girlfriend, I was overjoyed to find out she was a Pad Thai lover as well — a match made in heaven!
    </p>
    <p>I’ve made this dish with shrimp before which, is a pretty common way of serving it. Sometimes though, you just don’t have shrimp on hand so chicken comes to the rescue. Which is pretty much exactly what happened when I made this chicken pad Thai. The result? Big. Fat. Success. My girlfriend raved about it!
