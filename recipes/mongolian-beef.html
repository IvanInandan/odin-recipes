        <li>Slice the flank steak into thin Â¼" pieces. Toss with cornstarch, shaking off any excess and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a 10-inch skillet, heat 2 teaspoons of oil over medium-low heat. Stir in minced ginger and garlic and cook until fragrant, about one minute.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce, water, and brown sugar to the skillet, then bring to a boil. Let it boil for 3-5 minutes until slightly thickened. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a separate pan or wok over medium-high heat. Cook the beef in small batches for about 2 minutes. It does not need to be cooked through.</li>
